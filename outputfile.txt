Its lead investigational candidate, SM-88, is a novel first-in-class therapy that is designed to use cancer\'s unusual metabolism to selectively break down the cellular defenses of tumors, leading to tumor cell death. Through clinical trials and expanded access programs, SM-88 has been used in over 84 individuals and shown a clinical response in thirteen cancer types. In its first-in-human trial for end-stage, metastatic cancer patients, SM-88 treatment resulted in a median overall survival of 26 months, with 32% of patients alive at the end of the three-year evaluation period without any drug-related serious adverse events. The Company is currently conducting a Phase II trial in prostate cancer in addition to ongoing collaborations with the Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai and other institutions.
